      <div class="summary">I&#8217;ve been thinking about ways to promote indie comics. Perhaps if we could put together our own "Idol" competition for comics. We could get a lot of publicity for the competitors. It would give us a chance to talk about what we like and what we don&#8217;t like. We could establish some minimum requirements. These standards would help define when the aspiring maker was ready to compete. I think it would inspire comic book makers.</div>

      <div class="summary">By Ted Bergeron I&#8217;m trying to imagine what the future of comics will be. So I&#8217;m trying to create a 'blueprint' for making comics so that they still could be printed. Then take those files and make mobile apps, color e-books, web comics… every method of sharing comics digitally. The idea is books could be printed, if anyone wanted to pay a lot for one, but mostly they&#8217;d be shared electronically.</div>

      <div class="summary">Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates. This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</div>
