      <div class="summary">Tutorial by Ted Bergeron Scaling an image in GIMP is not easy like Photoshop. There are no handles to grab onto to transform and scale. So here we go. Starting files You&#8217;ll need a background image and a character image. A large cityscape image. A character image. I&#8217;ll use a potato on a white background so I can easily remove the white and make it transparent. Open GIMP and create a new file 7" wide x 10.5" high Create a layer to paste your background into Add city background Open your city background image Select all and copy (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C) Edit&#160;&#9656; Paste into your working image.</div>

      <div class="summary">Digital Publishing and Distribution By Ted Bergeron ⋅ March 21, 2012 ⋅ Post a comment I&#8217;m very interested in this topic but I think it&#8217;s confusing because you have "Printing" aspect; Digital formatting of your book to work on various e-readers, tablets, laptops and phones. I think this conversion process could be compared to a printing company creating a book. I&#8217;ve dabbled with this creating .pdf, ePUB and Kindle formats, but I haven&#8217;t really tested on anything other than my laptop.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Writing for the love of it. #2</h2>
      <div class="summary">Blog By Alverne Ball The other day a young creator twittered me a message asking how I started out in making comics. After relating a story where I tried to learn everything I could about the production of comics before jumping in feet first and learning on the go I came to the idea that this entry should be about how to start making comics. Once you&#8217;ve got your idea, the job as creator is to either write the tale or find someone that can write it for you.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Reality Competition to Find New Talent</h2>
      <div class="summary">I&#8217;ve been thinking about ways to promote indie comics. Perhaps if we could put together our own "Idol" competition for comics. We could get a lot of publicity for the competitors. It would give us a chance to talk about what we like and what we don&#8217;t like. We could establish some minimum requirements. These standards would help define when the aspiring maker was ready to compete. I think it would inspire comic book makers.</div>

How about "writing for the love of it". So that&#8217;s what this blog is going to be called and since this is the first of what I hope will be many let&#8217;s start with the inevitable. If you&#8217;re going to write comics then you have to first write for the love of it.</div>

      <div class="summary">FCBD Well 2012 is nearly here and already the big publishers have got their full line up for Free Comic Book Day coming up Saturday May, 5th 2012. This got me thinking, what&#8217;s stopping us Indie Comics makers from promoting our books? If we got together and each submitted 4 to 8 pages each, then grouped the pages by genre. We could print our own books and give them away at local comic book shops.</div>

      <h2 class="title">The Future of Publishing</h2>
      <div class="summary">By Ted Bergeron I&#8217;m trying to imagine what the future of comics will be. So I&#8217;m trying to create a 'blueprint' for making comics so that they still could be printed. Then take those files and make mobile apps, color e-books, web comics… every method of sharing comics digitally. The idea is books could be printed, if anyone wanted to pay a lot for one, but mostly they&#8217;d be shared electronically.</div>

      <h2 class="title">The Way Forward</h2>
      <div class="summary">If we all work together we can achieve our dreams. So step one has to be what are our dreams? As creators, I think we all want to work on making comics full time. So my first thought is why don&#8217;t I get a job as a comic book artist? Well, easier said than done. So I need to build a portfolio. Make some comics. Start showing off my work. Start knocking on big publisher&#8217;s doors.</div>
