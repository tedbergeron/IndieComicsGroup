&lt;p&gt;By Ted Bergeron ⋅ April 15, 2012 ⋅ Post a comment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;I am not a lawyer&#34;, but here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA as soon as you create a work, it is yours and generally accepted that you are reserving your rights.
Place &#34;© 2012 Your Name&#34; on your work to give notice of your copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past a strategy was to send a copy of your work to yourself via registered mail and never open the envelope until you needed to defend your copyright in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that by registering your copyright with the US Government, all you are doing is creating an official time-stamp on your work.
That date that you registered your work will have a greater legal weight in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#8217;s the kicker.
Your copyright notice and whether or not you have registered it with the US Government does not prevent anyone from stealing your work.
What it does to is enable you to defend your rights in a court of law.
You still have to hire a lawyer and go to court and take the proper steps to get the thief to cease and desist and more action to sue them for damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send in a whole stack of your comics and copyright the whole lot with one $35 registration fee.
So if it gives you peace of mind, it&amp;#8217;s pretty cheap.
And it&amp;#8217;s kinda cool to get a copy of your registration back from the government with their stamp on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more info: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/&#34; class=&#34;bare&#34;&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m making comics for fun and just want to share them.
I would be upset if someone stole my characters and tried to profit from them.
But I&amp;#8217;m not worried about it.
I&amp;#8217;d be flattered if someone made some fan art using them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_just_sketch_your_own_characters&#34;&gt;Just sketch your own characters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Disney has acquired Marvel, the Disney lawyers are going around comic cons and slapping cease and desist on any artist that is trying to sell sketches of Marvel characters for money.
So some of the voices in the industry are saying, &#39;just sketch your own characters&#39; … I think that is a great idea.
I think it mostly concerns famous artists that formerly worked for Marvel and fans know them for their work on those Marvel characters…
and they don&amp;#8217;t have any original characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Publishing and Distribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ted Bergeron ⋅ March 21, 2012 ⋅ Post a comment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very interested in this topic but I think it&amp;#8217;s confusing because you have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;Printing&#34; aspect; Digital formatting of your book to work on various e-readers, tablets, laptops and phones.
I think this conversion process could be compared to a printing company creating a book.
I&amp;#8217;ve dabbled with this creating .pdf, ePUB and Kindle formats, but I haven&amp;#8217;t really tested on anything other than my laptop.
My point is it can be done with time, talent, and a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distribution… that is tricky.
It would be great if once you had all your digital formats (files and apps) you could ship these off the &#34;comic book stores&#34;.
But in reality you have to get into the proprietary distribution pipelines like Amazon Kindle or Apple iTunes, Graphicly, Comixology, Diamond Digital  …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales… Generally speaking you could sell your own digital comics off your own website with a simple PayPal button and attach a PDF file and e-mail the customer.
I don&amp;#8217;t know if you can even get a Kindle book or iTunes app without going through their pipeline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m keeping an eye on this new store front: &lt;a href=&#34;http://indyplanet.com/digital/&#34; class=&#34;bare&#34;&gt;http://indyplanet.com/digital/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_we_need_an_open_universal_format&#34;&gt;We Need an Open, Universal Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an indie perspective, I&amp;#8217;d like to see us all agree on a universal open format (like ePUB or is there something better?) that works on almost most every electronic device and forget the color tablet wars that are competing for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Share
•&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No comments yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
